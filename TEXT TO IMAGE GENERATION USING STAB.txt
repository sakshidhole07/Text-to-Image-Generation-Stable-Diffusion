PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project demonstrates the use of a pre-trained generative artificial intelligence model called Stable Diffusion to generate realistic images from natural language text prompts. The system accepts a descriptive text input and produces high-quality images using deep learning techniques. The project is implemented using Python and executed on Google Colab.



OBJECTIVE
To understand text-to-image generative models
To generate images from natural language text prompts
To explore applications of generative AI
To implement an end-to-end AI image generation pipeline



TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
